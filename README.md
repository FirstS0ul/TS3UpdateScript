# TS3UpdateScript

**TS3UpdateScript** is the most used bash-script by companies to automate and optimaze the TeamSpeak 3 server update process. It is the fastest script you have ever seen for this task.

[Show TS3UpdateScript Best Practices](docs/TS3US_BEST_PRACTICES.md)

It checks, if a newer version for your TeamSpeak 3 server instance is available or not. If yes, you can choose, if the script should update the server or not. You also have some parameters like "delete old logs files" and so on. Well... If you don't want to update your TeamSpeak 3 server manually, you can use this script. This script is doing ALL steps for a correct update process of your TeamSpeak 3 server.

### Help us

We can not translate this script in each language, because we do not speak each language. But you can help us to get more language support by creating an own new language file with your mother language! And if you want to, send your translation to our email address above, that we can add your translation to the next version. As thank you we will name you in this document, if you want to.

Just grab a copy of your language file, which you understand and translate the content between the two quotation marks. If you think it is ok, you can send us this file via email and we will add it to the TS3UpdateScript. You also can check it in the GitHub Project as new "Issue".

## Work flow of the script

First it will check, if a newer version for the script self is available and afterwards it will check your installed version of each instance against the latest available version from teamspeak.de. It also will detect, if you are using TSDNS, SQLite or MySQL database and so on. If a newer version is available, the script will do following steps:

1. Download latest and named TeamSpeak 3 server files from 4players.de
2. Inform online clients on all virtual servers (if you want to; parameter '--inform-online-clients' needed)
3. Stopp running TSDNS (if used)
4. Backup temporary virtual server passwords (if any is available)
5. Stopp running server instance gracefully
6. Delete old logs (if you want to; parameter '--delete-old-logs' needed)
7. Create backup of currently running TeamSpeak 3 server in '/tmp/TS3Tools/TS3UpdateScript/'
8. Unzip downloaded TeamSpeak 3 server files
9. Import licensekey (if available), database and Query IP Black- and Whitelist from backup
10. Import TSDNS settings file (if used)
11. Delete ts3server.pid, if exists for correct start
12. Delete downloaded TeamSpeak 3 server files
13. Set ownership and group of files like before update
14. Start TSDNS (if was used)
15. Add commandline parameter to new ts3server_startscript.sh if INI-file is used
16. Start updated TS3 server
17. Restore temporary virtual server passwords (if any was backuped)
18. Script waits 15 seconds and checks, if the server is running
19. If the server is not running, the rollback will be executed
20. Clean up system from created and downloaded files for the update process

Those steps will the script execute for each installed instance, which will be checked.

The files/ directory will not be touched by the script - also not backuped!

## Used Ressources by the script

Protocol | Host/IP  | Used for | How often?
:------------- | :------------- | :------------- | :-------------
https | www.ts3-tools.info | Licensing server | Every 7 days or always, if your license is incorrect
http | dl.4players.de | Download server for TeamSpeak 3 server files | Each execution of the TS3UpdateScript
https | raw.githubusercontent.com | Server for checking latest TS3UpdateScript version | Each execution of the TS3UpdateScript
https | github.com | Download server for TS3UpdateScript files | Just if you update the TS3UpdateScript

## Directory Structure - Where can I find which file?

Path  | Description
:------------- | :-------------
.  | README.md, TS3UpdateScript.sh, .updateScript.sh, .ts3updatescript and the copy of the license
./docs/  | Install and upgrade guide as well as changelog
./configs/  | Configuration files
./languages/  | Language files

## Why got this script a high version number?

Because of the TeamSpeak 3 Server updates, customer wishes and suggestions to the script, however, constantly extended or optimized, which is the reason why it will never have a "final" version level.

The script is ready and fully functional.
