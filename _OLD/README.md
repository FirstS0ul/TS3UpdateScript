What is the TS3 UpdateScript?
============
It is the most used bash-script to automate and optimaze the TeamSpeak 3 server update process by big companies. It is the fastest script you have ever seen for this task.

It checks, if a newer version for your TeamSpeak 3 server instance is available or not. If yes, you can choose, if the script should update the server or not. You also have some parameters like "delete old logs files" and so on. Well... If you don't want to update your TeamSpeak 3 server manually, you can use this script. This script is doing ALL steps for a correct update process of your TeamSpeak 3 server.

Work flow of the script
============
First it will check, if a newer version for the script self is available and afterwards it will check your installed version of each instance against the latest available version from teamspeak.de. It also will detect, if you are using TSDNS, SQLite or MySQL database and so on. If a newer version is available, the script will do following steps:

1. Inform online clients on all virtual servers (if you want to; parameter '--inform-online-clients' needed)
2. Stopp running TSDNS (if used)
3. Stopp running server instance gracefully
4. Delete old logs (if you want to; parameter '--delete-old-logs' needed)
5. Create backup of currently running TeamSpeak 3 server in '/tmp/ts3server_backup/'
6. Download latest and named TeamSpeak 3 server files from 4players.de
7. Unzip downloaded TeamSpeak 3 server files
8. Import licensekey (if available), database and Query IP Black- and Whitelist from backup
9. Import TSDNS settings file (if used)
10. Delete ts3server.pid, if exists for correct start
11. Delete downloaded TeamSpeak 3 server files
12. Set ownership and group of files like before update
13. Start TSDNS (if was used)
14. Add commandline parameter to new ts3server_startscript.sh if INI-file is used
15. Start updated server
16. Script waits 15 seconds and checks, if the server is running
17. If the server is not running, the rollback will be executed
18. Clean up system from created and downloaded files for the update process

Those steps will the script execute for each installed instance, which will be checked.

The files/ directory will not be touched by the script - also not backuped!
